## Overview

The **ESP32-C6 USB Dongle** is a compact and powerful development board designed for wireless experimentation and prototyping. Powered by the ESP32-C6-MINI-1-N4 module, it supports the full range of wireless protocols including **Wi-Fi 6**, **Bluetooth 5 LE**, **Zigbee**, and **Thread (802.15.4)**.

It plugs directly into any USB-A port, making it an ideal tool for developers, testers, and tinkerers. Whether youâ€™re building a **Zigbee coordinator**, a **Thread border router**, or experimenting with **Matter** over Thread or Wi-Fi, this dongle has you covered.

## Key Features

* **ESP32-C6-MINI-1-N4** SoC (RISC-V, single-core @ 160 MHz)
* **4 MB Flash**, on-board PCB antenna
* Native **USB 2.0 full-speed** for power, serial, and JTAG
* Compact **USB-A plug** form factor
* **MP28164 3.3V regulator** (ultra-low quiescent current)
* **Reset** and **Boot** buttons for development
* **WS2812B-2020 RGB LED** for visual status and feedback
* **Ultra-low power operation** support (deep sleep)

## Getting Started

1. Plug the dongle into any USB-A port (PC, Raspberry Pi, powered hub)
2. Program it via ESP-IDF or Arduino using the native USB interface
3. Use it as:

   * Zigbee or Thread device
   * Coordinator for Zigbee2MQTT
   * Matter test device or border router
